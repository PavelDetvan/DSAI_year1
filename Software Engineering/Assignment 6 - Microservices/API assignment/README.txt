Assignment Report - Book Management System using Microservices Architecture

We are writing this file as our an explanation of our final submission for the assignment on developing a Book Management System
using microservices architecture. Sadly, our submission of the assignment is incomplete and does not meet the functional requirements.

Throughout the project, we invested significant time and effort in understanding the requirements and implementing the microservices.
However, due to various difficulties, we were unable to make the assignment work.

We faced challenges with the clarity of the assignment instructions, which made it difficult to comprehend the requirements accurately.
Additionally, we encountered issues with importing dependencies in our IDE (for some reason auto-import was not working), resulting in
compilation errors and functionality problems.

Despite seeking assistance from peers, software engineers, and teachers/teaching assistants, we were unable to resolve these problems.

Thank you for your understanding.
