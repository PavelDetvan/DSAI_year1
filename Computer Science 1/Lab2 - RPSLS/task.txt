Here you are asked to develop a version where the user plays against the computer! The rules are simple (as mentioned in the video in the link above):

Scissors cut Paper
Paper covers Rock
Rock crushes Lizard
Lizard poisons Spock
Spock smashes Scissors
Scissors decapitate Lizard
Lizard eats Paper
Paper disproves Spock
Spock vaporizes Rock
Rock crushes Scissors
Your program should ask the user to enter a play, and generate a random play for the computer, compare the two and announce the winner (optionally providing the reason!).

Download the empty RPSLO.java Download RPSLO.javafile and make sure your game works as follows:

For example, one run of your program might look like this:

Enter your play: R, P, S, L, O
> s
Computer play is L
You win!
Note that the user should be able to enter either upper or lower case r, p, s, l, o (for rock, paper, scissors, lizard, spock respectively). If the input is not one of the valid inputs, the code must show the message below and finish:

Invalid input (valid inputs: R, P, S, L, O)
For the computer’s play, you need to generate a random number and use a conditional to convert it to the actual play.

Then you have to (carefully and... painfully) design the conditionals that decide the winner.

Obviously, in the case that the computer play is the same as users play, we have a tie and you should print a message. We are counting on the fact the user will enter correct information and not something irrelevant (e.g. a number or any other letter).

For the computer’s choice print (replacing the _ with the capital letter of the computer’s choice): 

Computer play is _
When the player wins print: 

You win!
When the computer wins print: 

Computer wins!
In case of a tie print: 

It is a tie!
