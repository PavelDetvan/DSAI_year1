Objective

Develop an efficient algorithm for spell checking using a HashTable
Experiment with different hash functions and table sizes, and measure the performance of each configuration.
Tasks

Complete the provided HashTable class that can insert, search, and delete elements using the hashFunction method.
Complete the provided SpellChecker class that takes a string as input, check each word against the HashTable and returns a list of misspelled words.
Complete the provided HashTableTester class that tests the performance of the spell checker by measuring the time taken to check a document, the number of collisions, and the average search time for a randomly selected word.
Experiment with different hash functions and table sizes, and measure the performance of each configuration using the method implemented in the HashTableTester class.
Comment on the results of the experiments at the top of your source code.
