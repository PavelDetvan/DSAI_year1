Exercise 1 (5 points)
Write a program that creates a class Customer (with a constructor with two parameters: name and
prod list) which contains the name of the customer and a list with all his products (names and
prices).
1. You should create a function (equal to method in java) named add with two parameters: name
and amount, that adds new products with their prices to this list.
2. You should create a function products, that returns all the products of the customer along
with their prices as a list of tuples.
3. You should create a function expensive products, with a parameter price, that returns only
a list of names of the products that cost more than a specific value. In case this function would
return only a single value, you may also return a single string instead of a list.
Name the file that contains the Customer class customer.py.
Exercise 2 (5 points)
A prime number is a whole number greater than 1 that cannot be made by multiplying other whole
numbers. In other words, it can be divided only with 1 and itself.
Write a function (not a class) generate primes with a parameter end that generates primes from 1
to end. Name the file that contains the generate primes function primes.py (also provided as a
template).
Write a test program that calculates all the prime numbers from 1 up to 100.
