Exercise 1 (3 points)
Write a class FileCounter (template provided) that asks a user for a file name and keeps track of
the number of characters, words, and lines in that file.
First users of your class call the following method on a single file:
public static void processFile(String fileName)
After which, the following methods should return the word, character and line counts of the given
file:
public static int getWordCount()
public static int getCharacterCount()
public static int getLineCount()
You can use the provided FileCounter.java as a starting point and the files: file1.txt, file2.txt
and file3.txt to test your program.
Exercise 2 (3 points)
Write a class Find.java (template provided) that searches all files specified on the command line and
prints out all lines containing a reserved word given as the first parameter.
First write the method:
public static String[] getLinesWithWordForFile(String file, String word)
Which returns an array of lines, each containing the String word.
Next, write a main method that uses command line arguments to handle multiple files and a single
word to find the given word in all lines in all of the assigned files.
If you want to test your class, you need to pass some parameters in the command line. To that end,
you must compile it in advance. You can use, for example:
javac Find.java
java Find ring report.txt address.txt Homework.java
Then the program should print:
report.txt: has broken up an international ring of DVD bootleggers
address.txt: Kris Kringle, North Pole
1
address.txt: Home Simpson, Springfield
Homework.java: String filename;
Note: If you use ArrayLists to store the partial solutions, you may find the following link helpful to
complete this exercise.
Convert ArrayList to Array
Exercise 3 (4 points)
You should modify the BankAccount class (provided as a template) to throw an IllegalArgumentException
when the account is constructed with a negative balance, when a negative amount is deposited, or
when the amount that is not between 0 and the current balance is withdrawn.
Write a test program that causes all the three exceptions to occur and that catches them all.
