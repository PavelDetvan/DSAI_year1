Exercise 3 (4 points)
Enhance the ButtonViewer program (see the code below) so that it has two buttons, each of which
prints a message “I was clicked n time”. The value n should be incremented with each click and
may reflect the number of times the relevant button was clicked (therefore, two different counters
are needed). Make sure that all the components and functionalities are properly shown in the
video to be submitted!
import java.awt.event.ActionListener;
import javax.swing.JButton;
import javax.swing.JFrame;
/**
* This program demonstrates how to install an action listener.

public class ButtonViewer {
public static void main(String[] args) {
JFrame frame = new JFrame();
JButton button = new JButton("Click me!");
frame.add(button);
ActionListener listener = new ClickListener();
button.addActionListener(listener);
frame.setSize(FRAME_WIDTH, FRAME_HEIGHT);
frame.setDefaultCloseOperation(JFrame.EXIT_ON_CLOSE);
