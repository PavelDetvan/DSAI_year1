Exercise 1 (5 points)
Implement a class Car with the following properties. A car has a certain fuel efficiency (measured
in liters/km) and a certain amount of fuel in the tank. The efficiency is specified in the constructor
and the initial fuel level is 0. First, implement an accessor boolean method canDrive that can
decide whether the car can drive a certain distance with the current amount of fuel in the tank. Then,
implement a mutator method drive that simulates driving the car for a certain distance, reducing
the amount of fuel in the tank. In addition, implement an accessor method getFuel, returning the
current amount of fuel in the fuel tank, and a mutator method addFuel, to add fuel to the tank.
Test the methods of the class Car in the main method for the case when the car has been tanked
initially 40 liters of fuel and has to drive fro 400 km.
To simplify automatic grading of your solution please employ the following definitions of the methods
of class Car:
public Car(double efficiency)
public boolean canDrive(double distance)
public void drive(double distance)
public double getFuel()
public void addFuel(double fuel)
Exercise 2 (5 points)
In this assignment you will enhance the class Car that you implemented for Exercise 1.
Begin with a simple enhancement: add an instance variable to the Car class that represents the
car motor number. Modify the constructor of the Car class so that it assigns the motor number
sequentially. This means that the first Car object will get motor number 1, the second Car object will
get motor number 2, and so on. The second enhancement will help car owners to see how many
litters of fuel that added each time they were filling the tank. For that purpose you need to modify the
fields, constructor, and method addFuel in the class Car. The modified method addFuel in addition
to its previous functionality has to create a String object that describes the car number and amount
of fuel added to the tank. This String object has to be added to a global String object that contains
the descriptions of all the tank fillings so far for all the Car objects created. An example of the content
of the global String object is given below:
Car Motor Number 3: 20 liters
Car Motor Number 143: 15 liters
...
Car Motor Number 3: 15 liters
Car Motor Number 2: 45 liters
Provide an access method fuelRefills for the global String object and test this method in the
main method of the class Car when creating 3 â€“ 4 Car objects.
Hint: the global String object has to be referred by a static variable.
To simplify automatic grading of your solution please employ the following definition of method
fuelRefills of class Car:
public static String fuelRefills()
